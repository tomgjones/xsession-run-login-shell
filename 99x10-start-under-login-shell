# We get sourced by Xsession, which is interpreted by sh.

# The purpose of this module is to cause the X session to be run
# as a child process of the user's login shell.  This allows, for
# example, bash users to set environment variables in ~/.bash_profile,
# and have them available to processes in their session.

# This file's name puts it before "99x11-common_start".

# If there's a better way of having your X session in Debian run
# under a login shell, please let us know.

# <http://wiki.debian.org/DotFiles> has a good description of the
# problem that is being solved here.  Some more discussion is at
# <http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2005/06/msg03761.html>.

# See README for more discussion of this implementation.
